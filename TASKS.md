# TASKS — build checklist (tick as verified, not just written)

## Phase 1 — MVP
- [x] 1.1 Astro + TS scaffold, repo structure, base layout, single CSS, AdSlot placeholder component
- [x] 1.2 `db/schema.sql` applied locally; seed script (~50 sample titles) + seed removal note
- [x] 1.3 `sync/tmdb.ts` client (Bearer auth, 429 backoff, concurrency cap)
- [x] 1.4 Sync: changes + discovery collectors, filter, bundled detail fetch, transform + slugs
- [x] 1.5 Poster pipeline: R2 upload, WebP w185/w500 + profile w185 + backdrop w300 (sharp), idempotent
- [x] 1.6 Sync: D1 upserts, lookup counts, FTS update, sync_log, Telegram failure alert
- [x] 1.7 Workflows: `sync.yml` (daily 08:30 UTC + dispatch), `ci.yml` (typecheck + build)
- [x] 1.8 Home page (sections per design doc) + movies/series lists with filters + pagination
- [x] 1.9 Detail pages (movie + TV) with fixed anatomy; ratings strip; verdict widget; gallery
- [x] 1.10 TV season + episode pages
- [x] 1.11 Cast/person pages with filmography
- [x] 1.12 Genre / collection / language grids; `/new/`, `/top10/`, `/upcoming/`

- [x] 1.15 Watch page: geo country, provider groups, `/go/` outbound, JustWatch credit, no popunder
- [x] 1.16 `/go/[slug]` function: KV rules (country/device), batched click log, safe fallbacks
- [x] 1.17 `/api/vote` + My List/history (localStorage) + `/mylist/`
- [x] 1.18 Ads: slot resolution from KV, popunder session cap, Social Bar global slot, preview-safe placeholders

- [x] 1.20 Trust pages (About with TMDb attribution, Privacy, DMCA, Contact) + styled 404
- [x] 1.21 SEO: meta/OG/JSON-LD, dynamic sitemaps, robots.txt, noindex gating
- [x] 1.22 Deploy prep: `DEPLOY-CHECKLIST.md`, Cloudflare bindings wired, Phase 1 verification list run + reported
- [x] 1.23 Hybrid static tier: nightly workflow = sync → prerender hubs + top `static_top_n` titles → deploy; build fails if static files > 15,000
- [x] 1.24 CI speed gate: byte-budget hard fail (>~100 KB first screen) + Lighthouse mobile ≥90 report on home/detail/list (ads as placeholders)
- [x] 1.25 Speculation-rules prefetch on grids + CSS fade-in (no JS files added)
- [ ] 1.26 R2 custom domain + immutable 1-year cache headers; width/height on all images (CLS 0)

- [x] 1.28 Filter/sort URL control: noindex + canonical to clean URL (local routes verified; custom-domain edge rule deferred in VERIFICATION.md)
- [x] 1.29 Redirects table honoured before render (301); owner-deleted titles → 410; 404s logged to `notfound_log`
- [x] 1.30 OG cards: sync composes 1200×630 for gated titles → R2 `og/`; detail OG tags wired
- [x] 1.31 Poster colour: sync extracts dominant colour; placeholders + detail tint; scroll-snap swipe rows (Trending, Cast)
- [x] 1.32 "Streaming on" logo strip on detail (first 3 + "+N more")

- [x] 1.34 `backup.yml`: daily D1 + config export to R2 `backups/` (keep 14)
- [x] 1.35 Admin universal powers (ADMIN-PANEL §A): search/filter/sort/CSV, bulk edit, soft-delete → Trash (30-day, restore, "used in N places"), scheduling on links/ads/pins, actor-stamped history
- [x] 1.36 Not-working report (core checks: sync failures, missing poster/overview, empty/duplicate slots, visited 404s, quota > 80%) with Fix deep links
- [x] 1.37 Titles & People editor core: field edit + locks vs sync, pin/hide/delete (+ blocklist), re-fetch/import by TMDb ID via workflow dispatch, reset votes
